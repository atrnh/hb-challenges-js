Yes, this does include tests!

### installation & usage
In the root directory: make sure you have `npm` or `yarn` installed. Then install the required dependencies:
```
yarn install -or- npm install
```

To check your solution against the tests, simply run your solution file.

For example, if you are working on `addtozero.js`, run:
```
node addtozero.js
```
